**Create Tables**
```sql
-- Create the employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_title_id VARCHAR(10),
    birth_date DATE,
    first_name VARCHAR(255),
    last_name VARCHAR(255),
    sex CHAR(1),
    hire_date DATE
);
...
-- Create the dept_manager table
CREATE TABLE dept_manager (
    emp_no INT,
    dept_no VARCHAR(10),
    FOREIGN KEY (emp_no) REFERENCES employees(emp_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_no) REFERENCES departments(dept_no)
);
```
**Queries**
1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
